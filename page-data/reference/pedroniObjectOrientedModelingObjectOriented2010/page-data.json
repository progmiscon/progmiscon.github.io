Some of these challenges are due to the intrinsic complexity of the subject matter — object-oriented concepts are tightly interrelated and appear in many combinations. The present work describes an approach to modeling educational domains and reports on the results for object-orientation. It analyzes the dependency structure of object-oriented concepts and describes the implications that the high interrelatedness of concepts has on teaching introductory programming.","date":"2010","proceedingsTitle":"Teaching Fundamentals Concepts of Informatics","conferenceName":"","thesisType":null,"university":null,"place":"Berlin,
